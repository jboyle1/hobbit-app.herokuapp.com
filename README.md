## Name of Project: Hobbit fan page 

This project was an introduction to the Python programming language and Flask framework. It was to create a fan page from The 
Hobbit. It is for Thorin and his company of dwarves. This project was part of the online coding diploma I completed. The 
project covered: page templates, static files, passing data from view to a template, reading from a json file, iterating over 
json data, using if statements inside HTML, advance routing, creating a contact form, POST and providing feedback to the user, 
and adding requirements. This was a great stepping stone into the use of Python and Flask.
